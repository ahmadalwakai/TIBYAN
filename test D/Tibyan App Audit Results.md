# Tibyan App Audit Results

## Current Strengths
- **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive, and uses a modern design language (likely Tailwind/Chakra UI).
- **Clear Value Prop:** "Next generation of Arabic learning" with a focus on standards and commitment.
- **Multilingual Support:** Arabic and English (based on the toggle).
- **Dark Mode:** Support for color mode switching.
- **Interactive Elements:** Live chat and WhatsApp integration.
- **Role-Based CTA:** Clear paths for both students and teachers.

## Areas for Improvement (Initial Observations)
- **Visual Identity:** The hero section uses a generic stock photo; it could benefit from more "high-end" or "proprietary" visuals like Roya Academy's scholar-focused images.
- **Social Proof:** While it mentions "13k+ students," it lacks specific testimonials or high-profile scholar endorsements which are key for "high-level" platforms.
- **Content Density:** The landing page is relatively short. High-level platforms usually have more depth in explaining their *methodology* (e.g., Mindvalley's 6-phase meditation or Roya's tiered levels).
- **Engagement Triggers:** No clear "Lead Magnet" (free masterclass, assessment) visible on the landing page beyond "Explore Programs."
- **Trust Indicators:** No visible logos of partners, accredited institutions, or "As Seen In" media mentions.

## Technical Stack (Inferred)
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js (Vercel deployment).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or similar utility-first framework.
- **Features:** Dark mode, i18n, Chat widgets.
